# PharmAccess Foundation GitHub

PharmAccess is dedicated to improving healthcare in low- and middle-income countries through smart digital innovations, value-based care models, and public-private partnerships.

This github -[github.com/pharmaccess](https://github.com/pharmaccess)- is the central repository for all code development at [PharmAccess Foundation](https://www.pharmaccess.org/). It contains both public repositories for demonstrator projects for which the code has been open sourced, as well as private repositories for internal use.

## Digital Health Innovation
Our GitHub organization hosts the open-source components that power our mission to make inclusive digital health systems a reality.

In this GitHub organization, you will find:

- üß± **The Connected Care Stack**  
  A modular, standards-based architecture designed to enable patient-centered digital care journeys‚Äîstarting with maternal health.

- üîÑ **Interoperability & Data Infrastructure**  
  Repositories that support HL7 FHIR, OpenHIE, FAIR and other data sharing frameworks beyond The Connected Care Stack.

- üõ†Ô∏è **Supporting Libraries and Tools**  
  Shared libraries, utilities, and reusable components to support development and deployment across various healthcare use cases.

- üîê **Private Repositories**  
  Internal codebases for secure and ongoing program operations in implementation countries.

### Connected Care: Adopt & Adapt

**The MomCare Connected Care Stack** is a technical implementation for quality improvements in pregnancy care.

With its interoperable digital infrastructure we aim to support quality maternal healthcare delivery across low-resource settings. It connects the full journey of care‚Äîspanning enrollment, direct patient engagement, clinical touchpoints, data exchange, and analytics‚Äîinto a seamless digital ecosystem.
